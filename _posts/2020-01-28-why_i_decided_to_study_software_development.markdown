A creative soul learns to code.

I currently work as a QA engineer and love my job.

The reason I love working in software development is because I didn’t have to give up my passions. I studied music formally in college with the intent of becoming a music teacher, but had to drop out during the 2008 Recession.  I stumbled into tech that same year, by way of a job at the Apple Store.  That led me to work at the Genius Bar, then at other companies as an IT Support person, then a Data Analyst, then a QA Analyst, then a QA Engineer.  

I have spent many years playing in indie bands and a couple touring while always holding down full-time employment since that Apple job.  I used to identify as a musician but I now consider myself to be a multi-disciplinary artist, since I also study aerial arts and pursue other creative passions.  I used to throw fundraisers and make zines with my friends, I spent some time as a DJ, and I generally participate in a lot of small creative endeavors and love variety. 

Having a stable job in tech has provided me the economic opportunity to pursue my passions, which I struggled to do as a retail worker or as a working musician.  It also satisfies an intellectual need for me.  I love being able to use my scientific brain during the work day and turn on my creative brain after work.  I feel gratitude that I stumbled into this career path years ago. 

I'm an experienced QA Engineer with both manual testing and automation, but I would like to deepen my knowledge.  The next natural progression in my career is to deepen my skill set and become a full stack engineer.

I want to become a full stack software engineer because I want to make products that impact people’s habits and actions to benefit the greater good. My dream is to create software for a better world, rather than profit-driven software. I love the idea of creating software to benefit progressive activism. I'm also really interested in the idea of B Corps, companies that have both a profit and social responsibility.  On a personal level, I'm really curious about how programming can be leveraged for purely artistic purposes, with things like generative design.

Software has such a incredible impact on our daily behavior and has proven it has the power to change the way we interact with one another. Thus far this has mainly been used for profit but I would like to find a way to impact human behavior for the greater good, by making or contributing to software that people fall in love with.
