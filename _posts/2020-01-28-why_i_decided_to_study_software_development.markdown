I currently work as a QA engineer and love my job.

The reason I love working in software development is because I didn’t have to give up my passions. I have continued to play in bands and tour ever since that Apple job, and I also study aerial dance, throw fundraisers and make zines with my friends, I spent some time as a DJ, and I generally participate in a lot of creative endeavors. I love being able to use my scientific brain during the work day and turn on my creative brain after work.  I feel gratitude that I stumbled into this career path years ago.

I'm experienced with writing effective automated tests and sql queries, but I would like to deepen my knowledge.  The next natural progression in my career is to deepen my skill set and become a full stack engineer.

I want to become a full stack software engineer because I want to make products that impact people’s lives. My dream is to create software for a better world, rather than profit-driven software. I love the idea of creating software to benefit progressive activism. 

Software has such a incredible impact on our daily behavior and has proven it has the power to change the way we interact with one another. Thus far this has mainly been used for profit but I would like to find a way to impact human behavior for the greater good, by making software that people fall in love with.
