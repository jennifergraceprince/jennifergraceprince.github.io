This where I will explain my CLI project for Flatiron School and talk about some of the issues I ran into while building my program.

I created the gem Learn About Dogs, a CLI program that scrapes a website to help the user learn about the characteristics of various dog breeds.

Type the command below to get started:

$ bin/learn-about-dogs

The user selects a dog type from the menu, either by typing a breed name or the menu number. Once the user has selected a breed, they are able to select and view further details about the breed
